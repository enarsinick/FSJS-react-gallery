## Overview
---
For this project, we had to use the popular JavaScript library React to create an image gallery app. The image gallery will display content that is fetched from the Flickr API using the Fetch API/Axios. Below is a number of things covered in the project:
- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out gallery components in a modular fashion
- Used React Router to set up routes for some default topics and a search page
- Used the Flickr API to fetch images that could be used within the app
- Added logic to handle search requirements
